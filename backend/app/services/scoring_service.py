Scoring service: applies verification standing to the model's raw risk score,
binds each assessment to a tamper-evident hash, and re-scores a borrower when
their verification standing changes.

The adjustment rules are the same as the ones previously inline in the
credit endpoint. They are kept here as a pure function so that the endpoint,
the re-score path, and the verifier all compute the score the same way.
